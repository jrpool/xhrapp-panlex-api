## Discussion

This application demonstrates one method by which a web page can obtain information from a server, different from the server the page comes from, and include the retrieved information in the content of the page.

The page includes a `script` element that instructs the browser to execute the JavaScript script in the `app.js` file in the `src` directory. That script queries a third-party server and adding the received response to the page.

The script uses the `XMLHttpRequest` library to perform the query to the third-party server.
