    <h3>What are we demonstrating?</h3>

    <p>When you open this page, it does not contain any data, but it does contain code that requests a datum from a server and, on receipt of the datum, inserts it into this page below. That is what this page demonstrates.</p>

    <p>The request is sent to the <a href="https://dev.panlex.org/api/">PanLex API.</a></p>

    <p>The request asks the API to look up the word “мир” (best known as a Russian word that means both “world” and “peace”) in its database of about 25 million expressions in about 11,000 language varieties, and to return to us the count of language varieties containing that expression.</p>

    <p>If the answer appears below shortly after you open this page, then the code is working correctly.</p>

    <h2>Answer: <span id="count"></span></h2>
