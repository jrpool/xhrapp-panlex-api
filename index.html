    <h3>What are we demonstrating?</h3>

    <p>When you open this page, it does not contain any data, but it does contain code that requests a page from a server, on receipt of the page parses it to get some information about it, and then inserts that information into this page below. That is what this page demonstrates.</p>

    <p>The request is sent to the <a href="http://test-cors.org">test-cors</a> website.</p>

    <p>The request returns to us the site’s home page. This page’s code then counts those the “input” elements on that page and inserts the count below.</p>

    <p>If the answer appears shortly after you open this page, then the code is working correctly.</p>

    <h2>Answer: <span id="count"></span></h2>
